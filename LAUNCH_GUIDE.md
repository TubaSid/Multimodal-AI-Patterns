## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **"Build it in secret"**
- ✅ Share early, iterate with feedback

❌ **"Wait until it's perfect"**
- ✅ Ship v1.0, improve in public

❌ **"Only promote once"**
- ✅ Share regularly (different audiences, formats)

❌ **"Abandon after launch"**
- ✅ Maintain actively, respond to issues

❌ **"Vendor-lock to one model"**
- ✅ Stay model-agnostic (you already do this!)

❌ **"Ignore community feedback"**
- ✅ GitHub issues → roadmap priorities

---
