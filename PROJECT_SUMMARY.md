- Professional design following successful patterns (Agent Skills, Prompt Engineering Guide)
- Clear value proposition
- Modular, extensible design

### Community Ready
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Template for new skills
- Welcoming tone
- Room for growth

### Practical Value
- Real code examples
- Performance numbers
- Cost calculations
- Trade-off analysis
